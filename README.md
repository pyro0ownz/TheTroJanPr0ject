trojanProject-Discontinued 

Reason: This was a project for a RedTeam Vs Blue team for a cyber security group at my school. It would have been made with all detectable methods and built for windows xp machines. The goal of this was for students to understand old operating system archetectures to learn why the newer builds were made the way they were. Be my guest to fork this and use the code as a template for your projects.



     Warning I hold no responsibility what becomes of this template. All future authors hold their own responsibility. This was going to be a simple project and learning platform for cyber security students to understand how computers still get hijacked by malicious tools. Although there is minimal code, Anything forked from my github can link me to any malicious activities future authors would do by using my template because the original template originated by me. Any compiled builds or created files bear signatures from the original device used to create it. I will be focusing most of my energy and time more on reverse engineering, bug hunting and the automation of tools for vehicle security.
